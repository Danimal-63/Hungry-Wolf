# Hungry-Wolf
Flappy Bird, but a werewolf has to dodge pitchforks from angry villagers.
When the "ctrl/command" button is pressed, the pitchforks warp, they begin
longer or shorter while keeping the space in between the same so that it is
winnable

I made some poles as obstacles and I made the block movable up and down by the arrow keys
I have not yet made it game over if you hit the poles though.
